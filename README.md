# PortalWhere

An auto-inviting mage AddOn for World of Warcraft: Classic.  This AddOn is the result of a tutorial at 
void7.  Please [visit the blog](https://void7.net/how-to-make-an-auto-inviting-mage-portal-addon-for-world-of-warcraft-classic/) 
to show your support and discover how this all works.  You can make your own!

I currently play as a Horde rogue called Hankyshanky on the EU Shazzrah server.  Feel free to say hello!
